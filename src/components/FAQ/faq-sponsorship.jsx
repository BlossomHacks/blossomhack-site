    question: `What is a hackathon?`,
    answer: ` A hackathon is an event in which groups of 'hackers' get together to
              create a solution to a technological problem in a single day. Anyone
              who has an interest in technology attends a hackathon to learn,
              build, and share their creations over the course of a weekend in a
              relaxed and welcoming atmosphere. You don't have to be a programmer
              or majored in Computer Science to participate!`,

  {
    question: `What is the difference between sponsorship and donation?`,
    answer: ` Sponsorship is when a gift (money, supplies, etc.) is given to an organization with an expectation or an
              agreement of something in return (i.e. promotion for the donor). Donation on the other hand does not result
              in any benefit to the donor and most importantly can be claimed as a charitable deductible on the donor's taxes.`,

              swag, supplies, or prize support.`,

              so the funds can be collected. Please contact event leadership so 
              that we can ensure that the funds correctly arrive in our account and that you receive any sponsorship perks you request.`,
