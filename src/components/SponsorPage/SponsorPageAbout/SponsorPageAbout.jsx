      BlossomHack began as a way to increase awareness and 
      attendance of events put on by EECS student organizations. 
      Founders Alex Williams, Justin Garvey, and Natalie Soltis of 
      the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), Association 
      of Computing Machinery (ACM), and Ohio University Game 
      Developers Association (OUGDA) created the idea to combine 
      their club's annual events and after adding Drew Mullett and 
      Isabel Alvarez of the Institute for Electrical and Electronic 
      Engineers (IEEE) and Society of Women Engineers (SWE), the team 
      was able to produce BlossomHack 2023. The event had a total of 
      67 attendees with an over $12,000 prize pool, pushing dozens of 
      students to explore outside their comfort zone and learn new 
      skills.

      Currently, our mission for BlossomHack 2024 is to increase 
      the capacity for our hardware hacking section and give 
      attendees a greater chance to expand their comfort zone 
      through side events to introduce more computing concepts.
